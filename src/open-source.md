# Open-Source Foundation

ChaosHub builds on open-source components but requires custom integration:

- **LitmusChaos**: Provides the chaos engine and ChaosCenter Dashboard for experiment management.
- **Target App**: Fork a sample app like Google's Online Boutique for the mock e-commerce system.
- **Observability**: Use OpenTelemetry Demo for tracing setup inspiration.
- **Custom Components**: Build the analytics service, alerting service, and React frontend to tie everything together.

**Build Effort**: Starting with LitmusChaos and a sample app, expect 3-5 weeks for an MVP, focusing on integrating the DevOps/observability stack.
