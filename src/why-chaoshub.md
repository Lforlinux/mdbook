# Why ChaosHub is Ideal for Demonstration

- **Complexity**: Combines a chaos orchestrator, target app, analytics, and frontend, creating a realistic distributed system to test resilience.
- **SRE Relevance**: Chaos engineering is a core SRE practice, making the platform highly relevant for DevOps/SRE audiences.
- **Tool Showcase**:
  - **CI/CD**: Automates testing and deployment of microservices.
  - **ArgoCD**: Demonstrates GitOps with Helm chart deployments.
  - **Prometheus/Grafana**: Monitors experiment impacts and system health.
  - **OpenTelemetry**: Traces failure propagation across services.
  - **Terraform/Helm**: Manages cloud-native infrastructure and Kubernetes resources.
  - **LitmusChaos**: Provides a production-ready chaos engine with a user-friendly UI.
- **Engaging Demo**: Visualizing chaos impacts (e.g., pod crashes in Grafana) and recovery processes makes for a compelling presentation.
- **Scalability**: The platform handles high-load scenarios, showcasing AWS auto-scaling and resilience.
