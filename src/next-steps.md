# Next Steps

1. **Setup**: Deploy LitmusChaos on AWS EKS using Helm and Terraform (see Litmus Docs).
2. **Target App**: Fork Google's Online Boutique and instrument it with OpenTelemetry.
3. **Custom Services**: Build the analytics and alerting services (e.g., Python/Go) and the React frontend.
4. **CI/CD**: Configure GitHub Actions for automated builds and ArgoCD for deployments.
5. **Observability**: Integrate Prometheus, Grafana, and OpenTelemetry for metrics and tracing.
6. **Demo Prep**: Script a chaos experiment (e.g., pod crash) and visualize results in Grafana.
